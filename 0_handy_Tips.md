## 1. tmux 
Note 1, 11-13-2019
A very useful terminal multiplexer, using it I don't need to open so many terminals, and using the session functionalities, I can handle qrsh without worrying closing my jobs at the end of the day, or instability of internet. 
# Contr + b, + d : detaching a session
You cannot use the session feature on a qrsh node, as quitting that node will make tmux missing. you have to use tmux on the login node, then qrsh.

## 2. sudo
Note 2, 11-13-2019
To log in as an admin account doesnâ€™t mean you are the root, to do some operation, you still have to turn your self as root before doing so. 
to login to the administrator account
# su aauser
To become root as a god to do everything
# sudo su

## 3. Knitr::spin and #'
Note 3, 11-13-2019
When writing R codes, just use #' instead of # to make comments. This mark will make Knit automatically recognize the comments and R code sessions. So a R script can be used to generate a report, as well as to be run as Rscript directly. 

## 4. passing arguments to Rscript
Note 4, 11-13-2019
This way you can run Rscript using commend lines without an interactive session. 
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
args = commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)

## 5. Seurat is a S4 object in R
Note 5, 11-13-2019
Object-oriented programing are considered advanced R and is commonly used in almost all Bioconductor packages. 
Objects are defined with slots denoted by object@slot, each slot could have its slots or could be a generic class object.
R is more function-oriented language, not an object-oriented programing language (OOP).

## 6. commonly used organizational tools for data scientists
Note 6, 11-13-2019
## Jupyter lab
jupyter notebook is not good for interactive work. To install packages, should be done through the terminal instead of inside the notebook.

## Cookiecutter 
To clone the folder structure, to regularize folders, keep them organized. 
## Singularity/Docker 
For reproducible programming, to control operating system, software and language installed. 
## git/GitHub
For backup codes and version control.
For git push without using keys. First add key of the host computer to the github account; second, have to make sure the .git/config has the setting of ssh address.
for example, 

Open .git/config and find the [remote "origin"] section. Make sure you're using the SSH one:
## attention to the format:
ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git

And NOT the https or git one:

https://github.com/username/repo.git or 
git://github.com/username/repo.git 

## it may be troublesome to type this string all the time. 
you could put it as a bash executable file, into a folder in your PATH. so you could call the program to change the page.
gitCode
'
#! /usr/bin/sh
git add -u . && git commit -m $1 && git push
'
You could pass the comment as the $1 argument in your shell.

## Snakemake
To glue together pieces of codes and programs, to achieve pipeline automation
## All kinds of cheat_sheet
It is nice to have them as a personal dictionary, personally, I found it convenient to print out some for checking and for revision.

## htop
You have to log into the specific node to use the htop, to visualize the resource usage on that node.

## "|" in the shell script, pipe sign!
This sign generates data flow in shell scripts. 

## 7. "!" magic sign for shell script in Jupyter notebook.
## 8. To exit from emacs or xemacs press CTRL-X CTRL-C.
## 9 rSync to synchronize folders
rSync -av --delete --exclude 'data' -e ssh usr.name@biowulf.nih.gov:/path/to/the/folder ./
rSync can be dangerous as well. For the destination, it is always good have a designated folder. otherwise you may accidentaly erase all the files in you distination!!!
