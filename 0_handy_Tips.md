## tmux 

A very useful terminal multiplexer, using it I don't need to open so many terminals, and using the session functionalities, I can handle qrsh without worrying closing my jobs at the end of the day, or instability of internet. 
# Contr + b, + d : detaching a session
You cannot use the session feature on a qrsh node, as quitting that node will make tmux missing. you have to use tmux on the login node, then qrsh.

## Knitr::spin and #'

When writing R codes, just use #' instead of # to make comments. This mark will make Knit automatically recognize the comments and R code sessions. So a R script can be used to generate a report, as well as to be run as Rscript directly. 

## passing arguments to Rscript

This way you can run Rscript using commend lines without an interactive session. 
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
args = commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)

## Jupyter lab
jupyter notebook is not good for interactive work, as when the machine want you "yes" or "no" response, notebook will not let you.
To install packages, should be done through the terminal instead of inside the notebook. Jupyter lab offer that flexibility, and various other functionalities, such as file navigator in the same window. Jupyter lab extensions will allow you to enhance further the convinience of Jupyter lab.

## Cookiecutter

## git/GitHub
For backup codes and version control.
For git push without using keys. First add key of the host computer to the github account; second, have to make sure the .git/config has the setting of ssh address.

For example, 

Open .git/config and find the [remote "origin"] section. Make sure you're using the SSH one:

And NOT the https or git one:

https://github.com/username/repo.git or 
git://github.com/username/repo.git

## All kinds of cheat_sheet
It is nice to have them as a personal dictionary, personally, I found it convenient to print out some for checking and for revision.
